## Welcome to Hao's Home~

Here is the place I wanna share the books and movies I am now reading, fascinating places I am travelling or sometimes my causal thoughts.

The reason I start my own blog is looking for some friends who share similar taste to our world. Friends play a crucial part in our daily life

Sometimes we make friends cause we share analogous personalities, sometimes similar hobbies, or sometimes just in the same place. 

However I felt lonely when I had no one around sharing the pleasure after reading a intriguing book or a fantastic movies.
